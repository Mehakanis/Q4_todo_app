# Tasks: Bonus Features - Multi-language Support & Voice Commands

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-bonus-features-i18n-voice/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✅, spec.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification. Test tasks are excluded per specification guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Branch**: `008-bonus-features-i18n-voice` (already created and checked out)

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend-only implementation**: `phase-5/frontend/src/`
- **No backend changes required** (per plan.md - frontend enhancement only)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Language Switching**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Voice Task Creation**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but enhanced when combined
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Voice Task Operations**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US2 voice infrastructure
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Text-to-Speech**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses voice infrastructure from US2/US3

### Within Each User Story

- Translation files can be created in parallel (T019-T028 for US1)
- Component creation can be parallelized when working on different files
- Integration tasks must follow component creation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002-T006)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1 (Language) and US2 (Voice Creation) can start in parallel (different files)
  - US3 (Voice Operations) can start once US2 has command parser foundation
  - US4 (TTS) can start once voice infrastructure exists
- Translation file creation highly parallel (en.json and ur.json for each namespace)
- Polish tasks mostly parallel (documentation, testing, monitoring)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Language Switching)

```bash
# Launch all translation file creation in parallel:
Task T019: "Create initial English translation file with common namespace"
Task T020: "Create initial Urdu translation file with common namespace"
Task T021: "Add task-related translations (tasks namespace) to en.json"
Task T022: "Add task-related translations (tasks namespace) to ur.json"
Task T023: "Add settings-related translations (settings namespace) to en.json"
Task T024: "Add settings-related translations (settings namespace) to ur.json"
Task T025: "Add navigation translations (navigation namespace) to en.json"
Task T026: "Add navigation translations (navigation namespace) to ur.json"
Task T027: "Add authentication translations (auth namespace) to en.json"
Task T028: "Add authentication translations (auth namespace) to ur.json"

# Total: 10 translation tasks can run in parallel (5 namespaces × 2 languages)
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Voice Task Creation)

```bash
# Launch intent parsing and translations in parallel:
Task T039: "Add voice-related translations (voice namespace) to en.json"
Task T040: "Add voice-related translations (voice namespace) to ur.json"
Task T041: "Implement CREATE_TASK intent parsing"
Task T042: "Implement CREATE_TASK command execution"

# Launch component creation in parallel:
Task T043: "Create VoiceCommandButton component"
Task T044: "Create VoiceRecordingIndicator component"

# Total: 6 tasks can run in parallel initially
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Voice Task Operations)

```bash
# Launch all intent parsing in parallel:
Task T051: "Implement COMPLETE_TASK intent parsing"
Task T052: "Implement DELETE_TASK intent parsing"
Task T053: "Implement UPDATE_TASK intent parsing"
Task T054: "Implement FILTER_TASKS intent parsing"

# Launch all command execution in parallel:
Task T055: "Implement COMPLETE_TASK command execution"
Task T056: "Implement DELETE_TASK command execution"
Task T057: "Implement UPDATE_TASK command execution"
Task T058: "Implement FILTER_TASKS command execution"

# Total: 8 tasks can run in parallel (4 intents × 2 layers)
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (Text-to-Speech)

```bash
# Launch intent parsing and TTS logic in parallel:
Task T063: "Implement READ_TASKS intent parsing"
Task T064: "Implement SHOW_HELP intent parsing"
Task T065: "Implement task reading logic in textToSpeech.ts"

# Total: 3 tasks can run in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T018) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Language Switching (T019-T038)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Voice Task Creation (T039-T050)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both US1 and US2 independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - **This achieves 100% hackathon completion (1,700 points)**

**Rationale**: US1 + US2 deliver the core value proposition (+100 points i18n + +200 points voice = +300 total). These are both P1 priority and provide immediate user value. This is the recommended MVP scope.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (T001-T018)
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Language switching works)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Voice task creation works)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Full voice task management)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Text-to-speech reading)
6. Polish Phase → Production-ready deployment

**Benefits**: Each story adds value without breaking previous stories. Can stop at any point with working features.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T018)
2. **Once Foundational is done**:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Language Switching) - T019-T038
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Voice Task Creation) - T039-T050
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Voice Task Operations) - T051-T062
   - **Developer D**: User Story 4 (Text-to-Speech) - T063-T073
3. **Stories complete and integrate independently**
4. **Team completes Polish together** - T074-T090

**Maximum Parallelism**: 4 developers can work simultaneously on different user stories after foundational phase completes.

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks (T001-T009)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 9 tasks (T010-T018)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Language Switching)**: 20 tasks (T019-T038)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Voice Task Creation)**: 12 tasks (T039-T050)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Voice Task Operations)**: 12 tasks (T051-T062)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Text-to-Speech)**: 11 tasks (T063-T073)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 17 tasks (T074-T090)

**Total**: 90 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 1: 7 parallel tasks (T002-T006, T008-T009)
- Phase 2: 6 parallel tasks (T011-T014, T016)
- Phase 3: 10 parallel tasks (translation files T019-T028)
- Phase 4: 6 parallel tasks (T039-T044)
- Phase 5: 8 parallel tasks (T051-T058)
- Phase 6: 3 parallel tasks (T063-T065)
- Phase 7: 11 parallel tasks (most polish tasks)

**Total Parallel Tasks**: 51/90 tasks (57%) can run in parallel

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run simultaneously
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent testing
- **Each user story is independently completable and testable** - can stop at any checkpoint
- **No test tasks included** - tests not explicitly requested in feature specification
- **Frontend-only implementation** - no backend changes per plan.md
- **Translation completeness critical** - T081 validates all keys exist in both languages before deployment
- **Backward compatibility verified** - T089 ensures Phase I-V functionality preserved
- **100% hackathon completion** - US1 + US2 alone achieve +300 points (1,400 → 1,700)
- Commit after each task or logical group for safe rollback points
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Avoid: cross-story dependencies that break independence, same-file conflicts in parallel execution
